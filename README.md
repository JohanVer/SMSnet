## Models
The models can be downloaded here:
This repo contains the models trained on City-Kitti-Motion using EFS and without EFS
-Link1 (With EFS)
-Link2 (Without EFS)

## Test databases
The databases can be downloaded here:
-Link1 (Cityscapes test images)
-Link2 (KITTI test images)

Each compressed archiv includes 8 lmdb databases:

Labels:
-IMAGES_LMDB0: Labels with 20m range
-IMAGES_LMDB1: Labels with 40m range
-IMAGES_LMDB2: Labels with 60m range
-LABELS_LMDB:  Labels with inf range

Images:
-IMAGES_LMDB3: Left image corresponding to label
-IMAGES_LMDB4: Previous left image

Flow:
Note: The flow is centered at 128 and scaled by 1/6.4 in order to fit into the UC1 LMDB format
-IMAGES_LMDB5: Flow with EFS 
-IMAGES_LMDB6: Flow
